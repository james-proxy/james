# James

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/james-proxy/james.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/james-proxy/james)

James is an HTTP Proxy and Monitor that enables developers to view and intercept requests made from the browser.
It is an open-source alternative to the popular developer tool [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com/)

James is build with [hoxy](https://github.com/greim/hoxy), [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) and [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)

## Running in a development environment

The electron instance will automatically reload whenever a change is made

 1. Clone the repository
 2. `npm install`
 3. `npm run build`
 4. `npm start`

## URL Mapping

### Wildcard support

To use wildcards in the "url to map" field, put a "*" between two adjacent slashes. For example:
```
http://foo.com/version/*/app.js -> http://localhost:8000/app.js
```
Requests which will be redirected:
* `http://foo.com/version/1/app.js`
* `http://foo.com/version/26.8/app.js`
* `http://foo.com/version/spaghetti/app.js`

Requests which will **not** be redirected:
* `http://foo.com/version/app.js`
* `http://bar.com/version/1/app.js`

You can also use multiple wildcards in the same URL.
 
## HTTPs Support

To enable HTTPs support follow the [instructions in our wiki](https://github.com/james-proxy/james/wiki/Configuring-James-for-HTTPS)

## Other useful NPM Commands

- `npm run build`: Completely builds the app
- `npm run watch`: Watches JS, SASS and resource files, transpiling/copying them automatically. Lints sources on-change
- `npm run lint`: Checks all JS code against defined code styling rules
- `npm run test`: Runs all tests
- `npm run package`: Creates a standalone app bundle for all operating systems
